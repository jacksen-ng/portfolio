For Example, the Web Development will be more and more automated by the AI. And also the AI can help the developer to write the code more efficiently. People just need to give the idea to the AI, and the AI will generate the code for the developer.",

        project1Text2: "In this project, I proposed a new method to generate 3DCG from text. This project is about the tatics of basketball. Recently, people are using the whiteboard to draw basketball tatics. However, this method is not efficient and it is not easy to understand. New basketball players especially struggle to visualize plays and movements from static whiteboard drawings. To solve this problem, I developed a system that converts text descriptions of basketball into 3D visualizations. Users can input tactical instructions using natural language, and the system automatically generates an animated 3D scene showing player movements and play development. And I also write a paper about this project.",
